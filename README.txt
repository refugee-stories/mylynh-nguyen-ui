MYLYNH-NGUYEN-UI

I used: Bootstrap 4, CSS3 (animations), CSS, jQuery (for animation functions, animated carousel class to add and remove active class dependent on which slide), javascript for button functions, navbar functions, and carousel functions.

Side note: I also used images from unsplash and edited them to fit the layout and theme. I flipped images, cropped, changed saturation levels, colors, and added color filters to spur the feelings of inspiration and diversity, and to motivate others for action.
